# Smart-Delivery-Bot
Smart Delivery Bot is my final year major project—a Bluetooth-controlled indoor delivery robot using Arduino, IR sensors, ultrasonic path detection, and ESP32-CAM for live streaming. Presented at the IEEE Expo and published in IJSREAT for its innovation in embedded automation.

An autonomous indoor delivery robot built using Arduino and ESP32-CAM, capable of line following, obstacle avoidance, and live video streaming — developed as a final year major project and presented at the IEEE Expo.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔄 IR-based line tracking on a predefined T-path
- 🚧 Real-time obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensor
- 📷 Live video feed using ESP32-CAM
- 📱 Bluetooth control via mobile app (HC-05)
- 💡 Arduino Uno acts as the central control unit
- 🎓 Final Year Major Project | 🏅 IEEE Expo 2025 Participant

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Power on the bot — waits for Bluetooth input (A/B).
2. Follows the T-path using UltraSonic sensors.
3. Avoids obstacles using the IR sensors placed at the Corners of the bot.
4. Streams live video via ESP32-CAM.
5. Reaches destination, performs U-turn, and returns to the initial position.
